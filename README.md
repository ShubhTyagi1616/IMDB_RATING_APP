Overview:
The IMDb Rating App is a full-stack web application designed to showcase movie rating features similar to IMDb. Users can browse movies, view detailed information, and submit ratings. The app provides a seamless user experience by connecting the backend to the frontend via REST APIs.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: ReactJS
The appâ€™s user interface is built using ReactJS, enabling dynamic content rendering and a responsive design. Users can interact with the movie catalog and submit their ratings through the interface.

Backend: Spring Boot
The backend logic is developed using Spring Boot, which handles user requests, interacts with the database, and serves data via RESTful APIs. It ensures scalability and a modular architecture.

Database: MongoDB
MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing movie information, user details, and ratings. The non-relational nature of MongoDB allows for flexible storage of JSON-like data structures.

Key Features:
Movie Catalog: Users can browse through a list of movies with details like title, genre, director, release date, and ratings.
Rating System: Registered users can submit ratings for movies, and the average rating is calculated and displayed.
REST API Integration: The frontend and backend communicate through REST APIs to fetch movie data and post ratings.
MongoDB Storage: Movie details and user ratings are stored efficiently in a MongoDB database for scalability and performance.
Use Case:
The IMDb Rating App serves as a demonstration of a full-stack web application integrating a modern UI with a robust backend and database. It highlights how to build an interactive web service where users can engage with the platform through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for movie ratings.
